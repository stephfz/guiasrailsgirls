{"name":"Guiasrailsgirls","tagline":"Rails Girls Guides","body":"# Rails Girls Guides\r\n\r\nOur aim is to give tools for women to understand technology. The Rails Girls events do this by providing a great first experience on building the Internet.\r\n\r\nRails Girls was founded in end of 2010 in Helsinki. Originally intended as a onetime event, we never thought to see so many local chapters all around the world! This guide has been put together to help you get started.\r\n\r\nYou can use our materials and instructions to roll out your own workshop in your city, workplace or kitchen! Read more about Rails Girls at http://railsgirls.com\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nView the guides at http://guides.railsgirls.com or clone this repo and install & run [jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll)\r\n\r\n### Installing jekyll\r\n\r\n`cd railsgirls.github.com`\r\n\r\n`bundle install`\r\n\r\n### Pygments and Code Highlighting\r\n\r\nThe guides use the [pygments](http://pygments.org/) library to do syntax highlighting. If you don't have it installed you won't be able to see the highlight sections like the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n{% highlight %}\r\n{% endhighlight %}\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you aren't editing the code blocks, you can safely ignore this. If you want pygments, you can follow the [install instructions](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/wiki/Install) in the \"Pygments\" section.\r\n\r\n### Run jekyll\r\n\r\n`jekyll --server --auto`\r\n\r\n### Having trouble?\r\n\r\nYou might find some useful hints in this jekyll issue if it's not working as expected: [Issue 503](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/503)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Contributing a Guide\r\n\r\nTo contribute a guide, view the instructions at http://guides.railsgirls.com/contributing\r\n\r\n## Twitter\r\n\r\nFor updates and more follow [@railsgirls](https://twitter.com/railsgirls)\r\n\r\n## Website & Blog \r\n\r\nOfficial website and blog for Rails Girls movement can be found at http://railsgirls.com\r\n\r\n## E-mail list\r\n\r\nGlobal mailing list for Rails Girls events at http://groups.google.com/group/rails-girls-team\r\n\r\n\r\n## Credits\r\n\r\n* Karri Saarinen / [@karrisaarinen](https://twitter.com/karrisaarinen) / [github](http://github.com/ksaa)\r\n* Linda Liukas / [@lindaliukas](https://twitter.com/lindaliukas) / [github](http://github.com/lindaliukas)\r\n* Vesa Vänskä / [@vesan](https://twitter.com/vesan) / [github](http://github.com/vesan)\r\n* Terence Lee / [@hone02](https://twitter.com/hone02) / [github](http://github.com/hone)\r\n\r\n..and all the other coaches and people making Rails Girls awesome.
